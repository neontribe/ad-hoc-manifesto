# Agile apocrypha and an ad-hoc manifesto

> "Harry and Rupert present a survey of the cults, sects and heresies they’ve encountered while working with people “doing
> agile”, culminating in their formulation of a new “ad-hoc” manifesto. Doctrinal purists are invited to be appalled."

Yeah. Seemed like a great precis for a keynote did that, six months or so ago. And we are still going to do that: or at least there will be cults, there will be sects and there will be heresies. The fascinating thing about agile practises, or at least one of the many fascinating things, is how many people who practise them have read so little about them. Us, for example. I/Harry was at a session at UKGovcamp the other week - nice unconference, strongly recommended - and there was a session called "Agile sucks". The majority of people there - myself included - couldn't tell you how many tenets there were in the agile manifesto.

So, then we started to research various cults and sects and heresies, and found that other people had done that too. I'd noticed, for example, that some agile practises - like, real world practises - resembled pretty much the Cargo Cults of Polynesia. I found Liz Keogh (@lunivore) had done that precise blog post. Better. [Seven years ago.]( https://lizkeogh.com/2009/05/22/cargo-cults-and-agile-values/)

So we could start with that survey, and end with an entirely new manifesto, for sure. However, the more time we spent actually researching what we were going to say, actually looking outside our little bubble of experience, the more we found this.

## The agile manifesto rocks.

![a rock band](images/15575226235-thumb.jpg)

I mean, it rocks, it really does. It's ace. You need to go back and read it. And the Principles too.

We could stop there, but it'd seem a bit of a cop out. Hagiography isn't really my thing, and we given we disciples promise to question, critique and iterate we'd be letting the prophets down if we didn't. So here goes. A new precis.

Doesn't really slip off the tongue, does it?

One thing we won't change.

> "Doctrinal purists are still invited to be appalled."

Obviously.

## We start.

![it's an engineer. IT is happening](images/6833649749-thumb.jpg)

Let us the Manifesto in its history. It is 2001. When people thought of "famous software engineer", they probably thought "Bill Gates". Maybe Linus Torvalds, [if they read Time magazine.](http://web.archive.org/web/20070109132858/http://www.time.com/time/time100/poc/century.html) 

![MinecraftCarta](images/13508901354-thumb.jpg)

In 2001 there was no Minecraft, there was no Big Bang Theory, no IT Crowd. I'll say that again. [A world before the IT Crowd.](https://www.youtube.com/user/ITCrowdChannel) People didn't _really_ make multi-mega-movies based on computer games.

I imagine the actual formulation of the Manifesto as something like the Council of Nicea. (The Council of Nicea? A fourth century council of bishops who met to work out what Christians should believe; the Nicene Creed. They didn't ship the final version by the end of the council...)

Like theologians, we - Rupert and Harry - have no direct contact with the writers. In our case, because we're too lazy and too shy to mail them. So we can't know directly why the content of the agile manifesto is as it is, but we can attempt an analysis, using the tools of literary criticism, and guesswork.

![Text? A library](images/4335376117-thumb.jpg)

What, then, are the apocrypha? Well, they are those texts and practises which were around at the same time as holy writ, but did not make it in. 

The essay [cathedral and bazaar](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/) by Eric S. Raymond was four.

The [Psychology of Computer Programming](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Psychology-Computer-Programming-Anniversary/dp/0932633420) by Gerald Weinburg was already 30. (Go read that. His concept of ego-less programming is ace.)

Post-it (tm) notes were 24 years old! Invented bySpencer Silver of 3M, launched in 1977...

Extreme programming was two years old. This fine conference had run. Once.

Scrum was fifteen years old. (Yes, we were surprised too. The word itself was six or seven years old.)

| A Heresy: Scrum is a lousy metaphor. |
|----- |
| ![Lego Scrum](images/scrum-thumb.jpg) |
| A scrum is two packs, two groups of people, colliding and attempting to push each other backwards. That is not a good metaphor for constructive engagement. Turns out before then it was "rugby", and oh lord is that better... |

However, through a process that I imagine to be led by the wisdom of the prophets calling in the wilderness, a set of tenets was fashioned out of the competing visions of perfection. I imagine - perhaps wrongly - a scene with one of the prophets taking a sharpie to a draft copy late one night and no-one noticing it get to the final version without challenge.

Let us consider the tenets of this manifesto in turn.

## Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

![clone army](images/6182784051-thumb.jpg)

We believe time has moved on since the Manifesto, and that's has made this specific wording less useful, to us at least, than it once was. The difference, we think, here is partly in the mainstreaming of geek culture. 

We suspect the Manifesto was juxtaposing individuals against an industrialised process. Artisan against menial. That's done now, and while we must guard against a return to cube-slavery, it might bring a new threat. 

Within the community, there was not the cult of celebrity around developers there is now. The Cathedral and the Bazaar had only just been written, remember. We didn't have so many devs who cultivated a personal brand... Probably because the world wasn't so small... Social media has a lot to answer for.

The flip side (dark side?) the cult of individual brings with it is the glorification of individual effort over the work of teams. The cult of the rockstar developer. Later on we'll talk about collaboration, but it crops up here too. The opposite of individual isn't necessarily only slave, but also team member. For us there's a triangle there: individual, team member, slave at each apex.

![Rockstar](images/14112636141-thumb.jpg)

Reducing individuals to slaves, production line workers, call them what you will,  makes them incapable of their best work. They aren't capable of responding to change in the way agile demands. Their agency has been beaten out of them. That seems pretty clear. 

But it's our assertion that reducing a team member to an individual does the same. Over-valuing an individual makes it more likely they'll place their own interests over those of the team. Over-valuing any one skill set means valuing the skills of others less. It breeds arrogance, specialisation and kills the chances of change.  Rockstars are poison to teams.

![Boba Fett. Not a team player](images/5354781759-thumb.jpg)

There's an interesting parallel here with external consultants, we think, valued for their specific skills, rather than for fulfilling a "role on the team". That occasional import of expertise. The danger is that such expertise is valued purely because it is external. Obviously, this is an odd place for us to explore, because we're often just such consultants. However, if your consultants do not tread gently around your internal teams, do not respect the skills of others already there, if there's any part of the team's endeavour which is "beneath them", then you want to get different consultants. Yes, you have only a sporadic requirement for some skills, but the people who provide them need to be on the team too. They need to be able to shift their weight when demand changes.  

Otherwise you lose the team ethos and shared responsibility that we believe delivers good software.

| Heresy: 3 front-end devs, 2 back-end and a delivery manager please. |
| ----- | 
| ![Team GB](images/7747525828-thumb.jpg) |
| You can't body-shop an agile team. You recuit by skills, sure. The idea of "inter-disciplinary team" assumes there are disciplines to be inter. However, if you don't bear in mind the difficulty of team-building, your agility will be compromised. A team is not a collection of individuals. |

An agile team is inter-disciplinary team made out of specialists who have respect for other members, and don't assume others' jobs are easy. Human interactions are so complex than you have to make allowances for each other. Keeping that team ethos is hindered by technological tools of communications and.or pointless adherence to process that can get in the way to such a degree that nobody gives their anyone their full attention ever. Keeping that team ethos together when you're remote is still harder. 

| Heresy: Please, for the love of god, shut up. |
| ----- | 
|  ![Team GB](images/7747526978-thumb.jpg) |
I'm not even sure this _is_ a heresy, but it bugs the hell out of me. If you have nothing substantive to say in a scrum, say nothing. You don't need to prove you are working, we know that, we trust you and we can see what you're doing on the board. You're part of the team, remember? If you have a blocker, if something is getting in your way, say so. If someone _needs_ to know what you are doing, then holler. But if all you have to say is "I am a productive member of the team." then please - don't worry about it, we know. |

We have, however, come to value some processes and tools. Not the heavy-weight UML modellers that might have been what the prophets were railing against, but some things we've found handy. Stand-ups, prototyping, CLI... "Information radiators", Dashboards. 

| Heresy: Post-it (tm) notes not a panacea. |
|----- | 
| ![another witch burning](images/6291267341-thumb.jpg)
| This will have me burnt. |
| ...have any of you ever seen a post-it note leaving the office on someone's shoe? Yes. That. You know, Post-it (tm) notes are not even _mentioned_ in the Agile manifesto?|

### So we'd replace "Individuals and" with "team" - we value "Team interactions over processes and tools"

## Working software over comprehensive documentation

We've always found it pretty easy to buy into this, so much so that it rapidly becomes a truism, after all, working software is what your sponsors and users want, right? Deciding whether a piece of software is working or not turns out to be a really problematic area...

![A machine and some people that might be mechanics](images/4639456161-thumb.jpg)

* If you're building a client for an api which doesn't yet exist can you say it is working?
* If your approach was wrong and you've built an implementation which you intend to discard is that working?

Imagine for a moment that we scrub out "working" and replace it with "useful". Immediately, our problems above make more sense.

So, documentation...

| Heresy: Documentation is not a crime against agile. |
|----- | 
| ![someone making something work...](images/4335376117-thumb.jpg) |
| We'll gloss over the faith-crimes committed under this tenet, projects with deliberate no-documentation policies, assertions that good test coverage is, in itself superior to documentation simply because it demonstrates working-ness.  |

Let's hurry past the minor sins of omission justified by misreadings of this tenet. Very few people like to write docs, and not as many people read 'em as maybe should. There's a lot of laziness hiding under misreadings of this item.

I/Rupert is guilty as hell. The amount of documentation I, personally, have _not_ written is astonishing. I'm an expert in the field. But I'm not sheltering under this. I'm just an idiot, a short-sighted, lazy idiot.

When they wrote this they weren't talking about the sort of documentation I don't write. They were reacting against decades of oppression by overwhelming quantities of up-front specification.

I/Harry has been guilty as hell. I spent years working for a large US company writing BRDs, and helping write functional specifications. I'd hand them to a development team, over the fence erected between us, and say "How's that, then?". And they'd say something like "Awful." And I'd be sad for a while, assuming it was my fault it was a bad document, and then I'd ask "Have you _ever_ seen a functional spec. that was any good? Because then I could follow its lead..." And they'd say "Nope"... And then I'd feel a little better. It wasn't _entirely_ my fault a long and complex document with many many levels of nested numbered clauses wasn't much use in defining what the sofware should do.

![Overwhelming Specification Mime](images/8725106300-thumb.jpg)

We shouldn't confuse the futility of writing documentation of what software _should_ do with the noble and necessary work of documenting what software does, and how and why it does it. 

So, "Useful software over comprehensive documentation". Good.

While we're here lets fix the timing problem which can seduce us into reactionary thoughtcrimes, and at the same time we'll remove the stone under which anti-documentarianism born of laziness can hide.

### "Useful software _before_ comprehensive documentation". Right.

## Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

![a meeting gone bad, document being negotiated](images/5873697252-thumb.jpg)

We work for a company called Neontribe. It's a commercial company. We have customers. We even like to collaborate with them.  We like to have happy customers. And we don't get them by extensive contract negotiation that defines precisely and in great detail what the software we're building for them should do. 

Our best customer relationships are when we are most closely integrated into the customer. That's the kind of collaboration that works for us. When to the world outside, we are _part_ of our customer's team, not a supplier to them.

However, even then, we're speaking to a bipartite relationship. That's not good enough because it misses out the most important people. The people who will end up using the software you're building. Gaining utility from it. The users. Whether they're a direct source of value; by buying the customers' products, or they're the customers' employees and it's an internal piece of software you're building, they are the source of value for the software you're building. I mean, we are not the first people to trip over the lack of the word "user" in the agile manifesto, nor will we be the last, so this seems a small change but it's worth it, for us. 

In order to ensure that user stories are subjected to sufficiently critical thinking I encourage teams to use the variant form:

```As a <user type>, I want <function> so that <benefit> . AMEN " (Anonymous sage 2015)```

![happy people](images/16094729617-thumb.jpg)

It's not that we _don't_ value collaboration with the customer. We absolutely do, and as deep as possible, and we absolutely, definitely value it over contract negotiation. But we _also_ value collaboration with  other folk. Specifically, with the people who will use the software. Users. 

Our triangle here is between customer - team - user, with those 3 apexes. 

### We value collaborative delivery over contract negotiation. 

## Responding to change over following a plan

Following. Not "being enslaved by..."  or "adhering to in the face of all rational evidence to the contrary", or, indeed "having any semblance of"...

![all gone wrong](images/5527716890-thumb.jpg) 

Here's a situation:

There's a feature, and it has a user story, in the conversations which formed the user story folk were exemplary in not smuggling implementation instructions into it. The story looks good, resilient. It captures a user need, and couples it to a business objective - most people who read it understand it and can immediately suggest a couple of different ways to fulfil it. Perfect.

![Einstein writes a user story. It's got acceptance criteria.](images/567753250-thumb.jpg)

At this point someone remembers to add some acceptance criteria, or a definition of done, or somesuch. There's an obvious moment of danger here, the story wasn't prescriptive, but it is much easier for prescriptions to creep into acceptance criteria. But it might be that adding the acceptance criteria at all was the danger. It is hard to write good user stories; writing good acceptance criteria is harder still, since they approach functional specification - which as we all know exists in a quantum state fluctuating between impossibility and futility.

| Heresy: We don't need a plan. We're agile. |
| ----- |
| ![A pirate follows a map, which is a bit like a plan.](images/4153323914-thumb.jpg) |
| You are giving us a bad name. :-) Stop it. Agile _can_ go on and on without clear end: it needs _more_ discipline and a commitment to manage proactively. What agile give you the Manager is _more_ places to monitor. (Don't tell'em, for heaven's sake.) Smaller steps. More chances to see things aren't right. |

Next off some development gets done, some snags arise, approaches are attempted and discarded, conversations are had. All good.

Later some testing gets done. And the feature doesn't pass for all sorts of reasons. Some of which are that the acceptance criteria have failed to keep pace with the rate of change in the approach to delivering the story.

So how many things are wrong in this picture?

![Instruction. By the Emperor, as it happens.](images/7278423788-thumb.jpg)

What is happening here is a fine example of ritualized "agile" ceremonial.

Envisioning an end state, in this case in the form of acceptance criteria, has contributed this team's return to the false comfort of counter-revolutionary departmentalism. Within the lifespan of this user story there has been a reconstruction of the old scheme -  requirements were gathered, a plan was made (which would have looked very old fashioned if we'd not been distracted by the fact that it omitted every thing between A and Z) and then the work was pushed from analysis, to development to test in a micro-re-enactment of the broken waterfall sausage-factory. The development of the software was driven by documentation... just incomplete documentation.

![best waterfall I can find](images/5196920800-thumb.jpg)

That the testing specialist was unaware of the changing landscape of the story suggests that the team hasn't understood what inter-disciplinary can really mean and is still organizing itself by specialization and processing tasks according to the logic of the waterfall - that one stage cannot begin until a prior one has completed. Imagine that this team had reformed their notion of "working software", that they had set their cap at usefulness rather than compliance. Imagine that they had included the test specialist in all the conversations around the feature. Imagine that the tester had been given the authority their expertees merits, to evaluate the software against the user story without their approach being prescribed by a prior department. Imagine, in fact, that the program of agilism in this team had fully corrected (by which I mean effaced) the uneven power relationships which tend to assert themselves when we relax our vigilance.

![Fidel and Che](images/2635864070-thumb.jpg)

It is worth recalling here that we are reading a manifesto. A properly politcal document which aims at fomenting kaizen-revolution. A process which is necessarily incomplete if vestiges of old-think are allowed to shelter underneath rituals and mystifications. 

![Revolution](images/3427736164-thumb.jpg)

We _think_ we're agile - are we really? The good news is, most of us are a little agile, of only because when your waterfall process goes wrong - all you have left is ruthless focus on the most important things remaining. Most of us do respond to change, because your functional specification will get ripped up when you can feel the winds of deadline rushing past your ears. That's really interesting to me. I don't know about you, but the moments I loved about software development were the best crunches. Absolutely loved them - with the minor caveat that they break you in the end. So when _I_ heard about agile, I looked at it and thought... "Oh, it's crunches but lots of them, and they're all smaller and so less scary. Ace. Sign me up." Get some feedback that needs a change, have a quick chat, get the change in and tested? Great.

| Heresy: Those conversations that aren't. |
| ----- | 
| ![change can be worrying](images/4678498113-thumb.jpg) |
| The ones that leave "agile" as a fractal version of waterfall. A series of very small, badly mapped, waterfalls. That's not _bad_. Well, it's not as bad as really really big waterfalls. But you need to do better. You need to include the _relevant_ people in the team for example, not just you and another dev, and you need to document what you've said somewhere, and if you use "Oh, we're agile we don't do documentation" as an excuse, I will find you, and I will install IE6 as your only browser. I don't think that's unreasonable. |

Taken to a conclusion - Agile is constant upheaval. It's just not good enough to just respond to change, you have to bring it on yourself. 

That's it for me. Recognising the absolute inevitability of change, and not just responding to it, but embracing it.

### We'd replace "Responding to" with "Embracing", we value "Embracing change over following a plan."

## An ad-hoc manifesto?

Here we are at the end of a journey of sorts.

![Darth Vader relaxing on a sofa.](images/14626340083-thumb.jpg)

We aimed at a new manifesto, we aimed to poke fun at sects and heretics, the set in their ways, the defenders of cant and ossifised process masquerading as agility. The Cargo Cultists. And we have done that a little. But... We were missing the point. When we critically examined the original doctrine, we found what we had expected to rail against just wasn't there. Our solid complaints turned out to be our misconceptions.

What we actually found is that try as you might to critique it: it's a damned good thing, is the Agile Manifesto. Maybe a tweak or two. Or four, as we've tried to do, really for for reasons of neatness. Oh, and cheap rhetorical flourish, of course. But it's a damned good thing, and if you check back against it and its principles often, you'll be OK. Re-read it. 

Our manifesto for our software development.

* Team interactions over processes and tools
* Useful software _before_ comprehensive documentation
* Collaborative delivery over contract negotiation. 
* Embracing change over following a plan.

If we have any wisdom at all, any slight heresy to proclaim as new orthodoxy, then it is these two things:

![clone in chains](images/4368389868-thumb.jpg)

Retain humanity (Remember you serve your software's users as well as your customer...)

![everything is awesome](images/12798129015-thumb.jpg)

Distribute power, don't re-position it. (Remember not to swop the tyranny of process, for the tyranny of individualism. Remember you are part of a team, you are not a rockstar.)

If you can balance those, then you're doing very well indeed. Better than @harryharrold, better than @rupertredington, and as good as @neontribe at its best.

And always, always, return to the source. Critically re-examine it, re-emphasize it, if you wish. Do not treat it as an orthodoxy, for it is not. We've binned our efforts at creating a new manifesto, and suggest you do too, because it will always come back.
