Agile apocrypha and an ad-hoc manifesto - XP-2016
===========
This is the repo where myself and Rupert Redington nailed together our keynote "Agile apocrypha and an ad-hoc manifesto" at XP-2016

It's based on material we presented at Nordevcon 2015, which is kicking around at https://github.com/harryharrold/performance

Major differences are we used Reveal.js for the presentation this time - we actually have a "slide deck" rather than a stack of images we used at Nordevcon, and @marxian wrote a plugin for Reveal.js to make the green screen magic work.

The deck is at http://neontribe.github.io/ad-hoc-manifesto/#/
